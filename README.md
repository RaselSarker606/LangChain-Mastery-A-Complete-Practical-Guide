# 🌟 LangChain Learning Journey – Complete Hands-On Exploration 🚀

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository!  
This repo contains hands-on notebooks, scripts, and examples covering core concepts and advanced features of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) – a powerful framework for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📚 What You'll Find in This Repository

This journey is structured to help you understand and implement LangChain features step-by-step. Here's what I've covered:

### ✅ **Core Concepts**
- 🔹 LangChain Models (LLMs)
- 🔹 Prompt Engineering
- 🔹 Structured Output & Output Parsers
- 🔹 Chains & Runnable Interfaces

### 🧠 **Knowledge Management**
- 🔹 Document Loaders
- 🔹 Text Splitters
- 🔹 Vector Stores (e.g., FAISS, Chroma)
- 🔹 Retrievers

### 🔁 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Combine custom documents with LLMs
- Build smart Q&A systems with semantic search

### 🛠️ **Advanced Tools**
- 🔹 Tools & Tool Calling
- 🔹 Custom Tools Integration
- 🔹 AI Agents with Multi-Step Reasoning
